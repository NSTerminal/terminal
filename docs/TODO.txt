This is a list of the tasks to complete before each release.

Alpha 1:
  [ ] Split btutils - Put Linux GDBus functions in a separate file
  [ ] Add support for L2CAP over Bluetooth
  [ ] Unicode username support
  [ ] Add option to export Console output to a file in the user's Documents folder
  [ ] Export the GLFW error file (mainhandle.cpp) in a better location
  [X] Rework the Bluetooth selection menu UI
  [X] Remove threads from ConnWindow, handle socket events in ConnWindowList instead
  [ ] Fix dependency mess
    [X] Add scripts to download BlueZ/GDBus
    [ ] Compile GLFW from sources
      [ ] Adjust CMake scripts/VS projects as necessary
      [ ] Add download_glfw.py
      [ ] Remove libglfw3-dev from BUILDING.md
    [X] Make fork of GNU Unifont on GitHub
      [X] Add a download script
    [ ] Document Python downloader scripts

Alpha 2:
  [ ] Implement the server-side
    - This will get more detailed in the future when we get there.

Beta:
  [ ] System of saving IP addresses+names to make a "contacts list"
  [ ] In-app table of socket error codes/descriptions
    - Replace `unordered_map` with `map` to get the entries automatically sorted by code (ascending order)
  [ ] Pre-defined window dimensions
  [ ] Screenshot helper
    - On the Dear ImGui wiki: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/screenshot_tool
    - Add stb_image.h: https://github.com/nothings/stb
  [ ] Make settings configurable
    [ ] Settings UI (like in VSCode)
    [ ] Save in JSON format
      - Add JSON for Modern C++: https://github.com/nlohmann/json
    [ ] Allow saving/editing of Bluetooth SDP UUIDs
  [ ] Display first-party (GPLv3) and third-party licenses in app
  [ ] Display version/build information (build date/platform/compiler etc.)
    [ ] Display library versions (Dear ImGui/OpenGL/GLFW etc.) if applicable
  [ ] TEST EVERYTHING

1.0:
  [ ] Add relevant topics to repository
  [ ] Create issue/PR templates
  [ ] List features in main README
  [ ] UI reskin
    [ ] Change the app's colors from the default Dear ImGui styles
    [ ] Light and dark mode
    [ ] Figure out how to hide the spaces between tabs: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/4368
  [ ] Make app icon
  [ ] Update screenshots in repository
  [ ] Create an installer executable
  [ ] Obtain a code signing certificate

1.1:
  [ ] Raw sockets
  [ ] Send data in hex format in addition to the existing UTF-8 textbox
    - imgui_club Memory Editor (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_club) should be helpful here (make a modification of it?)

Various small optimizations:
  [ ] Use std::string_view (C++17) over `const std::string&` (Optional)
  [X] Use vector::find in ConnWindowList
  [X] Don't poll sockets that have been closed (modify relevant parts in ConnWindowList)
  [ ] Add a `Socket` class
    - Constructor takes a SOCKET parameter
    - Copy/move constructors deleted, sockets are always unique
    - send(), recv(), etc. member functions
    - Keep track of errors and open/closed state
    - Close managed socket fd on destruction as RAII

Other things:
  [ ] Setup GitHub Actions (whenever)
  - Profile application
    - Visual Studio debug tools on Windows
    - Valgrind on Linux (check for memory leaks)
    - Task Manager (CPU/GPU/Memory/Network use)
  [ ] When GCC and Clang are C++20 complete:
    [ ] Remove #if checks for chrono timezones (console.cpp)
    [ ] Drop formatcompat.hpp and {fmt}, use std::format()
  [X] Upgrade to VS2022
