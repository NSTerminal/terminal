# Network Socket Terminal Third Party Dependencies

This directory contains libraries that NST depends on, as well as the CMake script to build them.

In addition, there are various Python scripts to download the relevant files of each library from GitHub. These scripts are typically used to update, repair, or restore a library's source code.

TODO: This document needs improvement/expansion. Enhance it when the dependency mess is fixed in the Alpha 1 release.
